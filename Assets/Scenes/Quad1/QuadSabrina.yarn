<b>SABRINA:</b> I didn't expect the first day to turn out like this.
<b>ANDREW:</b> Yeah, I'm sorry about what happened. I'm gonna talk to them after class.
<b>SABRINA:</b> Good, I know they'll really appreciate that.
<b>ANDREW:</b> How mad are they?
<b>SABRINA:</b> They were annoyed, but I think they've calmed down. I think they're just upset now.
<b>ANDREW:</b> I'll try to fix this.
<b>SABRINA:</b> I think that's a good idea.
