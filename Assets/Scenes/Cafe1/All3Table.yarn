<b>BOTAN:</b> You found Sabrina!

<b>SABRINA:</b> Aha, it's nice to see you too, Botan.

<b>ANDREW:</b> You wanna get some food? We can watch your stuff for you.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Eh, I'm not really hungry.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Really? You've never turned down breakfast before!

<b>SABRINA:</b> I don't know, I'm just not feeling it today.

<b>BOTAN:</b> You should at least get something small to eat. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right?

<b>ANDREW:</b> She's probably just tired.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Maybe, but it doesn't give her the right to have an attitude.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Give her some time, maybe once she eats she'll have more energy.

<b>BOTAN:</b> I hope so.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Besides, we don't have your morning energy. Most people who wake up super early are irritated.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Why wouldn't she tell us? We tell each other everything.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Sabrina, when's your first class?

<b>SABRINA:</b> 9 AM.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Same! What's your class?

<b>SABRINA:</b> Painting.

<b>BOTAN:</b> You're gonna kick ass.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Aha, I doubt it. I'm not that good.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Dude, you're the best artist I know! Remember when you made that sick poster for my graduation present?

<b>ANDREW:</b> Oh yeah! The one with the three headed tiger on the mountain?

<b>BOTAN:</b> Yeah! That poster is the coolest thing I own.

<b>SABRINA:</b> You're way too kind, B.

<b>BOTAN:</b> I'm being honest! I love that poster, I have it hanging in my dorm near my bed.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Really?

<b>BOTAN:</b> Yeah! It's just so powerful. It makes me feel badass.

<b>SABRINA:</b> That's definitely your personality.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Botan, do you have an early class, too?

<b>BOTAN:</b> Nah, my classes don't start until noon.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Lucky you.

<b>ANDREW:</b> What class is it?

<b>BOTAN:</b> Abnormal psychology.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Really? You should have been in my class.

<b>BOTAN:</b> When is it?

<b>ANDREW:</b> It's at 9.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Wayyyy too early for me.

<b>SABRINA:</b> You say that like you don't function off two hours of sleep.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Yeah, but that's my me time! That's when I relax!

<b>SABRINA:</b> Actually, it's kinda funny, my abnormal psych class is today too.

<b>ANDREW:</b> When's yours?

<b>SABRINA:</b> It's at 2:30.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Andrew, why do you take such early classes?

<b>ANDREW:</b> I always think I can handle it. I try to use it as a way to motivate me to get up earlier.

<b>BOTAN:</b> How's that working out for ya?

<b>ANDREW:</b> It's only the first day. I'm exhausted.

<b>BOTAN:</b> That's why I wanted a later class for that. I can't talk about the brain this early in the morning.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Same.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Hey, have you guys looked at the syllabus for that class?

<b>ANDREW:</b> Yeah, why?

<b>BOTAN:</b> So do we learn about different disorders and stuff?

<b>SABRINA:</b> Pretty much. I know for the first few weeks, we're going over brain functions and how they can have an impact on developing a mental disorder.

<b>ANDREW:</b> Yeah, same for mine too.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Isn't there some psychologist that talked about dreams?

<b>SABRINA:</b> You're thinking of Freud.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Do you think we'll go over that stuff, too?

<b>ANDREW:</b> We're probably gonna talk about some of the psychologists, sure. Why do you bring that up?

<b>BOTAN:</b> I had a crazy dream last night. I've been wondering if it means something.

<b>SABRINA:</b> How crazy?

<b>BOTAN:</b> Pretty fucking crazy.

<b>BOTAN:</b> It didn't feel like a dream at first. I got up and went to the bathroom. As I was walking through the hall, something felt off. I mean, I was alone in the hall, but it didn't feel like it. I went to the bathroom and the lights were super dim. But there was someone in front of me all in black.

<b>BOTAN:</b> I asked if they were okay. They turned around and looked at me. I couldn't see their face, but their eyes were blinding. They were white and had no pupils. They started walking towards me; I wanted to run but I felt frozen. Before I could say anything, they grabbed my hand. I tried pulling away but their grip was so strong. They were mumbling under their breath. I couldn't hear a lot of what they were saying, but I remember some words. Stuff like "one being one" and "birth" and "death." Finally they leaned close and said "Your eyes are open, your mind is ready."

<b>BOTAN:</b> They let go of me. I was freaked out. I shouted at them, asking them who they were. They just said "In time, you will learn." Then they vanished! I had no idea where the fuck they went, they just faded out of sight. At this point, I was convinced I was hallucinating. Maybe I was just tired. I'm surprised I didn't piss myself right there. I took a deep breath and went to a urinal. I did my thing and went to the sink to wash my hands. When I started washing them, I heard this weird gurggling sound. I shrugged it off, maybe it was just the sink. But then it got louder and louder. Eventually, I looked into the mirror.

<b>BOTAN:</b> There was this giant fucking monster staring at me. It had two heads gaping at me. One had a hideous grin with these weird fucking eyes moving everywhere. The other face had this horrible frown with it's mouth open oozing some weird clear liquid. I ran to the door and tried to open it, but it was stuck. I banged on the door, I screamed for help. I was crying by this point. But no one came. Each time I pounded, I felt weaker and weaker. Eventually, I fell to the floor while this thing gawked at me. Their mouths were moving, but I couldn't hear what they were saying. Then... Its scream. Oh god, it made this high pitched scream that scared the fuck out of me. Then it rushed towards me and I screamed and... I woke up.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Wow...

<b>BOTAN:</b> Probably! I never had a dream that fucked up before!

<b>ANDREW:</b> I don't know, I think you just had a stress dream. With school starting, it makes sense to have a weird dream like that.

<b>SABRINA:</b> I guess that could be the case.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Did you guys hear what I said? That wasn't just a regular nightmare!

<b>ANDREW:</b> Maybe you should stop smoking before bed, I doubt that's helping you.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Maybe if I was smoking weed. I highly doubt cigarettes make fucked up dreams like that.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Well, it was probably just a really bad nightmare. Nightmares can't hurt you.

<b>ANDREW:</b> That sounds awful. I wonder if it does mean something.

<b>BOTAN:</b> I have no idea. This was way too real to not mean something.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Hey, have you kept a dream journal before?

<b>BOTAN:</b> No, I never did.

<b>SABRINA:</b> I have one and it's helped me when I have bad dreams. Maybe you can start doing that.

<b>ANDREW:</b> I didn't know you had a dream journal.

<b>SABRINA:</b> I started using it recently.

<b>BOTAN:</b> How does it help you?

<b>SABRINA:</b> Well, when I get a really bad dream, I write it down. Even if you don't believe your dreams mean something, the journal helps you get everything out. You can take a step back and focus.

<b>ANDREW:</b> That's pretty interesting.

<b>SABRINA:</b> Yeah, and even if I'm having a bad day, I just write down all my thoughts and let it out. It's soothing.

<b>BOTAN:</b> I think I'll try that.

<b>ANDREW:</b> I might, too.

<b>BOTAN:</b> Thanks Sabrina, this really helped.

<b>SABRINA:</b> I'm glad I can help. I'm sorry, I have to get to class.
